    "## Project Overview <a name=\"Project Overview\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing, authors leave distinctive marks in their stories influenced by the style of their writing. Well know writers are famous for their techniques with which they express ideas and manipulate language. Erika Rasso published a well written introduction to [Famous Authors and Their Writing Styles](https://www.craftyourcontent.com/famous-authors-writing-styles/). We learn, for example, that Ernest Hemingway \"pioneered concise, objective prose in fiction—which had, up until then, primarily been used in journalism.\". Another author discussed in Rasso's article is Franz Kafka. His stories present \"surrealist, nightmarish writing in contemporary settings\" which invoke feelings of confusion and helplessness. Agatha Christie's style was influenced by \"mentions of war\". Furthermore, \"she utilized a variety of poisons to carry out the murders in her stories\". And being interested in archarology \"resulted in ancient artifacts and archaeologists being heavily featured in her novels\". A last author worthwhile to highlight here is Zora Neale Hurston. Her style is quite unique: \"She wrote in colloquial Southern dialects that mimicked the language she grew up hearing.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intuition and experience as readers tells us that the style of writing is like a \"finger print\" that differentiates authors. If we come across a text with no information about the author or a text written under a preudonym, would we be able to tell the author based of the style of writing? An interesting article about [\"Who’s At The Keyboard? Authorship Attribution in Digital Evidence Investigations\"](www.utica.edu/academic/institutes/ecii/publications/articles/B49F9C4A-0362-765C-6A235CB8ABDFACFF.pdf) has been published by Carole E. Chaski. The article discusses the question to what extend text can be attributed to an author as part of crime investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will explore to what extend machine learning techniques can learn the style of writing for a set of authors. A learned system would then be given a text not seen before and tries to predict who the author is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook has been structured in the sequential order in which the problem has been approached. The next few sections describe the data set that has been acquired and the data cleaning activities applied. This is then followed by the main section that discusses various machine learning models. The models utilize various natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. The models represent different approaches to capture the \"uniqueness\" of writing of the different authors. The key metric against which we measure each model is the accuracy in correctly predicting the authors for a set of articles that have not been seen before (the test data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will have some fun and use the best performing model to build a small WhoWroteThis application. The user can copy and paste any text into a text input field and ask the system to guess who the author is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few notes on running this Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "The total run time for this notebook is 7.3 hours on a laptop with Intel i5-5300 CPU, 2.3GHz and 8GB RAM. The notebook requires a number of libraries. All required libraries are loaded in the first code cell. Make sure this completes without any error.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## Data Acquisition <a name=\"Data Acquisition\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow the system to learn the writing characteristics of different authors we require a dataset that provides a large number of articles for individual authors. There are rich datasets for NLP research available in the public domain. A list, as an example, can be found [here](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets). However, as part of this project we will build our own dataset. We will develop a web scraper that will collect articles from the publishing platform Medium. The articles on Medium seem to be reasonably long (at least several hundred words). There are enough authors that have published several hundreds articles. With this, it appears feasible to acquire a large enough data set to learn patterns in the writing characteristics to distinguish between individual authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has been chosen as an opportunity to develop practical experience not only in machine learning but also around data acquisition. In data science and machine learning the acquisition and preparation of high quality data is often the bigger challenge than the actual development of the machine learning system itself. In \"[Datasets Over Algorithms](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26587)\" author Alexander Wissner-Gross notes that \n",
    "\n",
    ">*\"the average elapsed time between key [machine learning] algorithm proposals and corresponding advances was about eighteen years, whereas the average elapsed time between key dataset availabilities and corresponding advances was less than three years, or about six times faster, suggesting that datasets might have been limiting factors in the advances.\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently the website [Top Authors](https://topauthors.xyz/) has published a list of 300+ top Medium authors. The project folder contains the short script `get_list_of_Medium_authors.py` that has been used to extract the Medium URL for each author. The initial list of 300+ authors has been reduced to 25. The criteria for this reduction was the number of published articles. For the 25 authors there are at least 300 articles available. The Medium URLs for these authors can be found in file `Medium_authors_25.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook/Top Authors.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "<center>*getting a list of Medium authors*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual collection of the articles is done with the script `pull_Medium_articles.py`. The script performs two steps. First, it builds a list of all article URLs and for each article saves author URL and article URL in JSON format in the file `Medium_article_urls.json`. Below is an example how the entries for three articles look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@tedr/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch/etiquette-and-the-cancer-patient-630a50047448?source=user_profile---------1----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@esterbloom/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/the-billfold/failing-at-shoplifting-life-with-kesha-bc2600b1f440?source=user_profile---------789----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@gassee/latest\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://mondaynote.com/the-ny-times-un-free-at-last-df2eddba360b?source=user_profile---------281----------------\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part performs the actual download of the articles. The script reads the article URL saved in `Medium_article_urls.json`, navigates to the website and reads the text information from the html code. Each article is saved in text format in its own file. For each author a folder is generated that contains the articles for that author. Initially it was intended to store all articles in JSON format in one file. This turned out to be very cumbersome when troubleshooting the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script. Having a folder structure that allows to do quick visual inspections over the list of files in a file manager proved very helpful. In addition, the smaller article files made it easier to spot check the downloaded text information in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src=\"notebook/article 1.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td>\n",
    "           <td><img src=\"notebook/article 2.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td>\n",

    "<center>*It's not good working with text. Got stuck reading instead of getting on the with project.*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "During research for this project several Python libraries for interacting with websites have been explored: [mechanize](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/0.3.6), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#), [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). Eventually the decision was made to use the Selenium WebDriver. The key reason for this was: the Medium website uses a two step login process. The users provides its email address and then receives a one time login link via this email. That made it difficult to automate the login via script and ruled out all the libraries that don't allow user interaction with the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an article website is loaded, the required information can be pulled from the text attribute of specific html elements. The code snipped below shows the commands used to get the author name and the article text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "author = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//a[@rel=\"author cc:attributionUrl\"]').text\n",
    "body = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//div[@class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\"]').text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the code snippet above the right elements are addressed by their respective xpath. Finding these xpaths required a bit of trail and error. A valuable tool for this is the FireFox Inspector. It allows to inspect the code and structure of a website and to find the right path to the right html element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top Authors](notebook\\Firefox Inspector.jpg)\n",
    "<center>*finding the right xpath with Firefox Inspector*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script completed, the folder `Medium_articles` containing all article files has been compressed into a ZIP archive to preserve storage. With [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) Python provides a library to work with ZIP archives. Going forward in this Notebook we will make use of this library to work with the files directly within the ZIP archive without the need to extract the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a web scraper script poses its own challenges. The initial idea is pretty straightforward: here is a list of URLs, go to each website, download the text part and save it in a file. As always, the pitfalls are discovered during implementation. Some time had to be invested to understand the structure of the Medium article websites and figure out the best way to find the right html elements that contain the required information. The Selenium WebDriver is not the most effective tool when it comes to scraping several thousand websites. The time to render each and every website adds up. An attempt has been made by parallelising the article download with multi-threading and spawning of several instances of the Firefox browser. This failed. It turned out that the fast sequence of websites caused Firefox to slowly consume all available memory and eventually Firefox stopped fetching new websites. In a parallelised version of the script the problem was only exaggerated. Finally, a pragamatic approach was taken and the script has been amended with the capability to continue the work where it has left off from a previous run. Over the course of several days the script has been restarted several times and eventually saved all articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In defense for Selenium, it needs to be noted that Selenium first and foremost is a tool to automate testing of websites and not a tool for scaping several thousand websites. The primary goal behind the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script was to get the data for this capstone project and not to develop a sophisticated web scraper. In this respect Selenium did the job. Despite the challenges, developing the web scraper script has been a worthwhile learing experience. It provided an opportunity to develop practical experience around data acquisition.\n",

    "In the next section we will explore the data set. We will also check what data preparation or cleaning activities might be required before we can apply learning algorithms to the data set."

      "Body: In search of: non-sterile mushroom cultivation tek\n",
      "Continuing my investigations into the wonderful wild world of (non-wild) mushroom cultivation.\n",
      "I had the presence of mind just now to take some photos as I run through my usual process of spawning onto oats.\n",
      "This part I am super good at, continuing my mycelium culture indefinitely under non-sterile conditions. I started originally with a spore syringe (white oysters), grew them out on BRF cakes (brown rice flour) in my SGFC (shot-gun fruiting chamber) using the PF-Tek method. Everything is cryptic acronyms in the world of mushroom growing. “Tek” is how they say “technique”, but I’ve kind of come to like it.\n",
      "Anyway, after my BRF cakes, which yielded very low sporadic results, I switched to live tissue samples (cloning) onto grains. At first, I was going through all the recommended steps of sterile procedure, glove box, wiping everything down with alcohol, flame sterilizing my scalpel — the whole nine yards. And originally, I was soaking my grains (rye and barley which I had at the time) for 24 hours, then boiling for 30 minutes, then adding my tissue samples.\n",
      "After a little more than a week, I was ending up with results like this:\n",
      "Which is pretty much what you want. Nice strong spawn run (the white stuff) throughout the the liter mason jar. A jar not unlike this, but 3–4 generations back, became my “grain master.”\n",
      "My first G2G (grain-to-grain transfer) went fine, except it made me realize that my glove box is really too short to facilitate G2G under sterile conditions. I mean you can do it, but it’s just such a pain in the ass. And I wasn’t in the mood to go buy another plastic container to make a bigger glove box. Plus I’d heard open-air transfers could work, but they had higher contamination rates. I decided to give it a try.\n",
      "Basically, once you have your master, you take it and slam it against a tire to break up the spawn so you can pour it into your next generation of jars. When you’re done, you end up with something like this:\n",
      "“Pleurote” is oyster mushroom in French.\n",
      "Anyway, since switching to this technique several weeks back, I’ve used it many many times and have had absolutely 0% contamination (knock on wood). I’m also not using any air filter thingamabob like they always say you’re supposed to in the instruction “tek” videos and tutorials.\n",
      "I just take approximately (no need to be exact) 1 cup of dry grains to 2 cups water per each 1L jar you want to fill. Add some used coffee grounds (about a “scoop”) and some gypsum. I don’t actually know what the coffee grounds are supposed to do — boost it somehow? Probably you don’t need them. But anyway, I know the gypsum (easily found in the garden section of big box stores as a lawn additive of some sort) is supposed to help keep your colonized grains from clumping together too much. So when you bang your master against the tire, it all comes apart easily for pouring.\n",
      "So you boil you grainy-mix with a lid until steam shoots out, then lower the heat and boil for at least 30 minutes. It’s to saturate the grains, not to sterilize them. Then you strain it for a few minutes, and I am impatient/busy so I pour my jars immediately with the boiled grains (even though they’re still hot) and then stick them in the freezer for five minutes. By then, they’ve cooled down enough that I’ll pour in “a bit” of my grain master into the next generation jars.\n",
      "It’s simple really: you want to start with boiled grains filling up around half your fresh jars. Then the more master spawn content (inoculum I think is the “correct term”) you pour into each one, the faster it will colonize. My lids have been punched with four nail holes each and are inverted and screwed on (not too tight). I shake the inoculum up with the new grains, label the date and variety and stick them in a box at room temperature.\n",
      "Usually it’s looking pretty decently white after 3–4 days, but if you wait a little longer, the colonization will become even denser. I usually end up doing a G2G every 8–9 days or so, depending on the rest of my workload. If you wait too too long or your conditions aren’t good, you may start to see an orange liquid in your jars (this starts more like 2–3 weeks). This isn’t the end of the world, but is a sign to make your transfer relatively soon. Anything green or blue, black or whatever is probably contamination, but I’ve avoided it to so far.\n",
      "I’ve done this same technique again and again with the oysters and now a couple times off a patch kit I bought for King stropharia/garden giant/wine caps. All totally not sterile, open air, etc. All without any problem. The wine caps I’m using to inoculate a big pile of straw/used poultry litter underneath my hops vines. I don’t know how long that will take, but I have a “good feeling about it.”\n",
      "Getting the oysters to fruit, of course, is another matter. My G2G tek I could conceivably run all night and all day without problem and end up with hundreds and hundreds of inoculated jars. But after that, I have yet to achieve success.\n",

      "I know this “looks sketchy” but I can assure you that a whole lot of “high-level science” is being performed here!\n",
      "The “burrito” on the far right is basically one (or two I can’t remember) spawn jar emptied out into layers of straw, and then folded in a nice chicken wire tortilla. I was watering it occasionally. This room used to be a potato warehouse in a garage and is pretty cool (no idea on actual temp) and shaded. There is natural light, but not direct. I thought it would potentially be a good inoculation area for the straw to get colonized.\n",
      "If you strip away the outer straw layer a little, you can see the colonization is actually decently underway (though not amazingly so):\n",
      "Sorry for the bad photo, my “camera is broken”\n",
      "Anyway, today I moved this guy out of its darkened chamber and hung it up in my greenhouse to hopefully see if some natural light for a few hours in the morning will initiate pinning.\n",
      "The other two bags hanging are variations on the same concept, but “wrapped in plastic” to quote Twin Peaks. The one on the right has a roll of fencing in it to hold the burrito form, and the one on the left has straw just loose:\n",
      "Not sketchy!\n",
      "The bag on the left is “oxo-biodegradable,” a product I picked up at a local pharmacy and investigated a little bit on the web. I’m not sure it’s the answer, but is it better than other forms of plastic? The plastic question continues to vex me, and there appears to be no perfect environmental answer — yet.\n",
      "If someone wants to make a “disruptive” start-up to “hack” something, why don’t they “hack” plastic bags already? Jesus christ!\n",
      "The bags have air holes poked all around them. The straw in exactly none of these was sterilized. Neither was it chopped like you’re supposed to do. The blue bag has maybe twice the number of inoculum jars in it. I’m trying sort of a buckshot approach around the best probable answer… See what sticks to the wall.\n",
      "An old homesteader from way back I stayed with while WWOOFing told me when he starts a new thing, he always gets three books about it by different authors and follows one of the sets of instructions exactly. Then he goes out and tries his own way. That’s probably good advice, but it’s not what I did. I’ve never been one to follow instructions well, but for everything up until the straw phase of the game, I at least tried it the “right way” at first.\n",
      "Now I’m trying to find out what’s the absolute bare minimum process to follow that will yield a reliable/predictable result. I haven’t found it yet. But tomorrow I’m finally going to bite the bullet, cut up some straw (somehow or another) and pour boiling water over it into a big tote bin and let it soak for an hour.\n",
      "Because what I’m doing now probably *could* work — eventually. But I want this to all work out sooner than later. Time’s a wastin’ and my season is in full-swing. If I can add oysters (and wine caps) to my existing client offerings, I can stand to profit quite a lot while offering some nice products.\n",

Bag-of-Words is a very simple but often surprisingly effective algorithm. It takes all the different words in a training set and uses them as features. Each article is then transformed into a feature vector by marking the occurrence of each feature (=word). There are a few variations of Bag-of-Words. In it's basic form each vector counts the number of occurrences for each word. This is what we are going to use in this model 3. In the next section (model 4) will use the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) approach to build the Bag-of-Words vectors.\n",

According to the [scikit learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) SVM is a classifier that generally is effective in high dimensional space and, more importantly, is \"still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples\". In our case the number of 63,021 dimensions (= features) is significantly higher than the 5,756 samples (= number of training articles). Perhaps, because in our case the number of dimensions is almost ten times the number of samples make SVM unsuitable for our problem. The SVM library in scikit learn offers options for optimisation such as various classifiers (SVC, NuSVC and LinearSVC) and different kernel functions. For this project SVM has not been pursued further as the initial results (see above) are way below what the logistic regression classifier achieved."

Also, John Westenberg has been misclassified six times as Gary Vaynerchuk. The examples show that misclassification can be concentrated to a few classes. With this confusion matrices can provided valuable cues that are helpful for further fine tuning models."

    "With all the code for Model 3 developed with reusability in mind, we can now quickly implement another model that utilizes the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) approach. In TFIDF, similar to word count, each word represents a feature. Each word is assigned a weight factor that is higher the more often a word occurs in an article. However, at the same time the weight of a word is reduced the more often it occurs across other articles. The idea behind TFIDF is that words that occur more across multiple articles carry less meaning then specialized words that occur within a smaller number of articles.\n",

    "The performance of the TFIDF model with logistic regression is almost identical to the word count model described in the previous section. The TFIDF of words doesn't help to increase the accuracy in predicting the author. This can be explained by the fact that authors most probably write about specific topics (e.g. entrepreneurship, astrophysics). With this we can expect a high frequency of key topic words within the articles from the same author but less so across all articles in the training set. This in turn means that the IDF part of TFIDF has less impact on the learning. Which then means the TFIDF gets closer to what the word count does."

    "Another approach to numerically represent meaning in text is offered by using word embeddings. Word embedding algorithms such as Word2Vec and GloVe aim to find similar representations for words with similar meanings. Individual words are represented by vectors with tens or several hundred dimensions. These vectors are learned by processing a large amount of text through a neural network. During learning, the algorithm learns the embedding either by predicting the current word based on its context or by predicting the surrounding words given a current word. The result of the embeddings learning phase is a set of vectors where words with similar meanings have similar vectors. Essentially \"similarness\" is represented by the distance between word vectors. The vector representations of words with similar meanings have shorter distances between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years word embedding approaches have been one of the key breakthroughs in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this promising outlook we will test the word embeddings approach on our problem in the following two models. Model 8 will learn word embeddings as part of the convolutional neural network (CNN). In model 9 we will use pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very helpful resource for this topic was the book \"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, Develop Deep Learning Models for Natural Language in Python\" from Jason Brownlee. From this book  (page 163) the CNN used in this model has been taken. The model has been modified to a multiclass classifier (original model was a binary classifier for sentiment analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key learning from implementing this model: The `one_hot` function from the `keras.preprocessing.text` library was originally used to convert the words in articles to integer values. This was done as preparation to train the CNN. However, `one_hot` does not encode collision free. During testing it has been found that against a text corpus with 54,619 unique words `one_hot` caused 22,793 collisions. Meaning 22,793 integers were not uniquely mapped to single words. It is believed that this high proportion of collisions significantly distorts the learning of the embedding CNN. To resolve this issue function `learn_vocabulary` has been implemented (see below)."

    "When predicting authors based on word embeddings learned from scratch we achieve a prediction accuracy on the test data of 13.18% (please note, results vary significantly with different runs of this notebook). This is a very low prediction accuray. This can be explained by the fact that the word embeddings were learned from only 5,756 articles (around 3.5 million words/tokens). Word embeddings are algorithms that require large amount of training data to properly learn relationships between words. Available pre-trained word embeddings were trained on significantly larger text corpora. For example the GloVe word embeddings file [glove.6B.zip](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) contains 6 billion tokens and a vocabulary of 400,000 words and was trainind on the Wikipedia corpus.\n",

    "It is interesting to see that the good old logistic regression classifier in model 3 has achieved a prediction accuracy of 92.55%. With that it has significantly outperformed all other classification approaches. This is a good reminder that, even with todays state of the art algorithms, it's always worth to look into simpler algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the more sophisticated models 8 & 9 with word embeddings and CNNs didn't perform better, is probably because of the small size of training data available. Word embeddings require large volumes of training data to pick up the relationship between individual words. For the problem addressed in this project, predicting the authorship of a given text, the amount of training data will always be very limited. As shown in section [Exploring the Data Set](#Exploring the Data Set) the most active authors have produced a few hundred articles. Only six have produced 1,000 and more articles. If an application needs to be developed that needs to classify articles into topic categories (sport, gardening , science, ....) then the amount of training data will definitely be much higher as much more authors will write about the same topic. This would make the word embeddings approach worthwhile to revisit. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthwhile to note that model 2 achieved a prediction accuracy above 30%. This model was build only on features reflecting the number of words in articles, paragraphs and sentences. The model does not take anything of the article content into account. In future improvements this model might be used as part of an ensemble learner to improve the prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development of this notebook some effort has been put into refactoring the code with re-usability in mind. Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for testing approaches and algorithms. Once a promising model has been identified, it is expected that a notebook like this will be handed over to an implementation developer who will transform the code into something that can be shipped to production. Models 3 - 9 have been implemented as Python classes with a consistent interface providing `train`, `predict` and `score` methods. Pre-processing activities have been \"packaged\" into separate functions which supports reuse and, hopefully, code readability. It is believed that instilling a \"production usable\" mindset in machine learning engineers will benefit the quick transition of new ideas into usable applications. The last section in this notebook demonstrates the simplicity with which the successful model 3 can be used in a simple application.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important learning from this project is to keep an eye on testing the different stages of the machine learning pipeline. For all of the models discussed above the raw text from the articles had to be transformed in several stages in order to be used with a classifier or a neural network. The initial text cleaning tasks (removal of punctuation and stop words, stemming, transform all words to lowercase) are fairly straightforward and can be validated by a simple visual inspection of a few samples. It gets a bit more tricky when text is transformed into numbers such as word counts or, even more so, integers that act as pointers to word vectors. Are the numbers I now see are integer indexes or still the word counts from the model I tried earlier? Am I sure that each word/token has now been encoded with its unique integer value? The challenge with machine learning implementation is that bugs not necessarily manifest themselves in hard stops of the code. How do you know whether the reported prediction accuracy of X% is because of the limits of the model or because of a bug in your vectorization code? To address this it is worthwhile for machine learning engineers to be mindful about testability of the different stages of a machine learning system."
