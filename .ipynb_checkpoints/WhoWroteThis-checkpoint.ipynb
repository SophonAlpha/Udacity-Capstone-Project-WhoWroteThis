    "## Project Overview <a name=\"Project Overview\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing, authors leave distinctive marks in their stories influenced by the style of their writing. Well know writers are famous for their techniques with which they express ideas and manipulate language. Erika Rasso published a well written introduction to [Famous Authors and Their Writing Styles](https://www.craftyourcontent.com/famous-authors-writing-styles/). We learn, for example, that Ernest Hemingway \"pioneered concise, objective prose in fiction—which had, up until then, primarily been used in journalism.\". Another author discussed in Rasso's article is Franz Kafka. His stories present \"surrealist, nightmarish writing in contemporary settings\" which invoke feelings of confusion and helplessness. Agatha Christie's style was influenced by \"mentions of war\". Furthermore, \"she utilized a variety of poisons to carry out the murders in her stories\". And being interested in archarology \"resulted in ancient artifacts and archaeologists being heavily featured in her novels\". A last author worthwhile to highlight here is Zora Neale Hurston. Her style is quite unique: \"She wrote in colloquial Southern dialects that mimicked the language she grew up hearing.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intuition and experience as readers tells us that the style of writing is like a \"finger print\" that differentiates authors. If we come across a text with no information about the author or a text written under a preudonym, would we be able to tell the author based of the style of writing? An interesting article about [\"Who’s At The Keyboard? Authorship Attribution in Digital Evidence Investigations\"](www.utica.edu/academic/institutes/ecii/publications/articles/B49F9C4A-0362-765C-6A235CB8ABDFACFF.pdf) has been published by Carole E. Chaski. The article discusses the question to what extend text can be attributed to an author as part of crime investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will explore to what extend machine learning techniques can learn the style of writing for a set of authors. A learned system would then be given a text not seen before and tries to predict who the author is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook has been structured in the sequential order in which the problem has been approached. The next few sections describe the data set that has been acquired and the data cleaning activities applied. This is then followed by the main section that discusses various machine learning models. The models utilize various natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. The models represent different approaches to capture the \"uniqueness\" of writing of the different authors. The key metric against which we measure each model is the accuracy in correctly predicting the authors for a set of articles that have not been seen before (the test data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will have some fun and use the best performing model to build a small WhoWroteThis application. The user can copy and paste any text into a text input field and ask the system to guess who the author is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few notes on running this Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "The total run time for this notebook is 7.3 hours on a laptop with Intel i5-5300 CPU, 2.3GHz and 8GB RAM. The notebook requires a number of libraries. All required libraries are loaded in the first code cell. Make sure this completes without any error.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## Data Acquisition <a name=\"Data Acquisition\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow the system to learn the writing characteristics of different authors we require a dataset that provides a large number of articles for individual authors. There are rich datasets for NLP research available in the public domain. A list, as an example, can be found [here](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets). However, as part of this project we will build our own dataset. We will develop a web scraper that will collect articles from the publishing platform Medium. The articles on Medium seem to be reasonably long (at least several hundred words). There are enough authors that have published several hundreds articles. With this, it appears feasible to acquire a large enough data set to learn patterns in the writing characteristics to distinguish between individual authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has been chosen as an opportunity to develop practical experience not only in machine learning but also around data acquisition. In data science and machine learning the acquisition and preparation of high quality data is often the bigger challenge than the actual development of the machine learning system itself. In \"[Datasets Over Algorithms](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26587)\" author Alexander Wissner-Gross notes that \n",
    "\n",
    ">*\"the average elapsed time between key [machine learning] algorithm proposals and corresponding advances was about eighteen years, whereas the average elapsed time between key dataset availabilities and corresponding advances was less than three years, or about six times faster, suggesting that datasets might have been limiting factors in the advances.\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently the website [Top Authors](https://topauthors.xyz/) has published a list of 300+ top Medium authors. The project folder contains the short script `get_list_of_Medium_authors.py` that has been used to extract the Medium URL for each author. The initial list of 300+ authors has been reduced to 25. The criteria for this reduction was the number of published articles. For the 25 authors there are at least 300 articles available. The Medium URLs for these authors can be found in file `Medium_authors_25.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook/Top Authors.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "<center>*getting a list of Medium authors*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual collection of the articles is done with the script `pull_Medium_articles.py`. The script performs two steps. First, it builds a list of all article URLs and for each article saves author URL and article URL in JSON format in the file `Medium_article_urls.json`. Below is an example how the entries for three articles look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@tedr/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch/etiquette-and-the-cancer-patient-630a50047448?source=user_profile---------1----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@esterbloom/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/the-billfold/failing-at-shoplifting-life-with-kesha-bc2600b1f440?source=user_profile---------789----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@gassee/latest\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://mondaynote.com/the-ny-times-un-free-at-last-df2eddba360b?source=user_profile---------281----------------\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part performs the actual download of the articles. The script reads the article URL saved in `Medium_article_urls.json`, navigates to the website and reads the text information from the html code. Each article is saved in text format in its own file. For each author a folder is generated that contains the articles for that author. Initially it was intended to store all articles in JSON format in one file. This turned out to be very cumbersome when troubleshooting the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script. Having a folder structure that allows to do quick visual inspections over the list of files in a file manager proved very helpful. In addition, the smaller article files made it easier to spot check the downloaded text information in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src=\"notebook/article 1.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td>\n",
    "           <td><img src=\"notebook/article 2.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td>\n",

    "<center>*It's not good working with text. Got stuck reading instead of getting on the with project.*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "During research for this project several Python libraries for interacting with websites have been explored: [mechanize](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/0.3.6), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#), [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). Eventually the decision was made to use the Selenium WebDriver. The key reason for this was: the Medium website uses a two step login process. The users provides its email address and then receives a one time login link via this email. That made it difficult to automate the login via script and ruled out all the libraries that don't allow user interaction with the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an article website is loaded, the required information can be pulled from the text attribute of specific html elements. The code snipped below shows the commands used to get the author name and the article text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "author = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//a[@rel=\"author cc:attributionUrl\"]').text\n",
    "body = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//div[@class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\"]').text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the code snippet above the right elements are addressed by their respective xpath. Finding these xpaths required a bit of trail and error. A valuable tool for this is the FireFox Inspector. It allows to inspect the code and structure of a website and to find the right path to the right html element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top Authors](notebook\\Firefox Inspector.jpg)\n",
    "<center>*finding the right xpath with Firefox Inspector*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script completed, the folder `Medium_articles` containing all article files has been compressed into a ZIP archive to preserve storage. With [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) Python provides a library to work with ZIP archives. Going forward in this Notebook we will make use of this library to work with the files directly within the ZIP archive without the need to extract the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a web scraper script poses its own challenges. The initial idea is pretty straightforward: here is a list of URLs, go to each website, download the text part and save it in a file. As always, the pitfalls are discovered during implementation. Some time had to be invested to understand the structure of the Medium article websites and figure out the best way to find the right html elements that contain the required information. The Selenium WebDriver is not the most effective tool when it comes to scraping several thousand websites. The time to render each and every website adds up. An attempt has been made by parallelising the article download with multi-threading and spawning of several instances of the Firefox browser. This failed. It turned out that the fast sequence of websites caused Firefox to slowly consume all available memory and eventually Firefox stopped fetching new websites. In a parallelised version of the script the problem was only exaggerated. Finally, a pragamatic approach was taken and the script has been amended with the capability to continue the work where it has left off from a previous run. Over the course of several days the script has been restarted several times and eventually saved all articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In defense for Selenium, it needs to be noted that Selenium first and foremost is a tool to automate testing of websites and not a tool for scaping several thousand websites. The primary goal behind the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script was to get the data for this capstone project and not to develop a sophisticated web scraper. In this respect Selenium did the job. Despite the challenges, developing the web scraper script has been a worthwhile learing experience. It provided an opportunity to develop practical experience around data acquisition.\n",

    "In the next section we will explore the data set. We will also check what data preparation or cleaning activities might be required before we can apply learning algorithms to the data set."

      "Author: Jean-Louis Gassée\n",
      "Headline: The Network Is the Computer: Google Tries Again\n",
      "Body: The Network Is the Computer: Google Tries Again\n",
      "All you need is a dumb device attached to a smart network. It’s an old idea that refuses to die despite repeated failures. Now it’s Google’s turn.\n",
      "In the late 1980s, Sun Microsystems used a simple, potent war cry to promote its servers: The Network Is The Computer. Entrust all of your business intelligence, computing power, and storage to Sun’s networked SPARC systems and you can replace your expensive workstation with a dumb, low cost machine. PCs are doomed.\n",
      "Nothing of the sort happened, of course. Sun’s venture was disrupted by inexpensive servers assembled from the PC organ bank and running Open Source software.\n",
      "PCs prospered, but that didn’t dampen the spirits of those who would rid us of them.\n",
      "Fast-forward to the mid-1990s and thought re-emerges in a new guise: The Browser Will Be The Operating System (a statement that’s widely misattributed to Marc Andreessen, who holds a more nuanced view on the matter). The browser will serve as a way to access networked services that will process your data. The actual OS on your device, what sort of apps it can run — or even if it can run any (other than a browser) — these questions will fade into insignificance.\n",
      "Soon after, Oracle took a swing at the Network is the Computer piñata by defining the Network Computer Reference Profile (or NCRP), a specification that focused on network connectivity and deemphasized local storage and processing. It was understood, if not explicitly stated, that an NCRP device must be diskless. A number of manufacturers offered NCRP implementations, including Sun (which would ultimately be acquired by Oracle) with its JavaStation. But despite Larry Ellison’s strongly expressed belief that Network Computers would rid the industry of the evil Microsoft, the effort went nowhere.\n",
      "Today, The Network Is The Computer lives on under the name Cloud Computing, the purest example of which is a Google Chromebook running on Chrome OS. (And thus, in a sense, Sun’s idea lives on: Google’s first investor was Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim.)\n",
      "So far, Chromebooks have shown only modest penetration (a topic for musings in a future Monday Note), but despite the slow adoption, Google has become one of the largest and most important Cloud Computing companies on the planet. Combine this with the Android operating system that powers more than a billion active devices, could Google bring us to the point where The Network Really Is The Computer?\n",
      "It’s a complicated question, partly because the comparison with the previous generation of devices, traditional PCs, can (excuse me) cloud the view.\n",
      "Unlike PCs, smartphones rely on an expensive wireless infrastructure. One can blame the oligopolistic nature of the wireless carrier industry (in English: too few companies to have a really competitive market), but that doesn’t change the simple fact that wireless bandwidth isn’t cheap. The dumber the device, the more it has to rely on the Cloud to process and store data, and the more bandwidth it will consume.\n",
      "Let’s visit Marc Andreessen actual words regarding Network-As-Computer, from a 2012 Wired interview [emphasis mine]:\n",
      "“[I]f you grant me the very big assumption that at some point we will have ubiquitous, high-speed wireless connectivity, then in time everything will end up back in the web model.”\n",
      "If we interject, on Andreessen’s behalf, that wireless connectivity must be as inexpensive as it is ubiquitous, then we begin to see the problem. The “data hunger” of media intensive apps, from photo processing to games, shows no sign of slowing down. And when you consider the wireless bandwidth scarcity that comes from the rapid expansion of smartphone use, it seems that conditions are, yet again, conspiring against the “dumb device” model.\n",
      "The situation is further confounded when we consider that Google’s business depends on delivering users to advertisers. Cloud computing will help drive down the cost of Android handsets and thus offer an even wider audience to advertisers…but these advertisers want a pleasant and memorable UI, they want the best canvas for their ads. When you dumb down the phone, you dumb down the ad playback experience.\n",
      "In a recent blog post titled The next phase of smartphones, Benedict Evans neatly delineates the two leading “cloud views” by contrasting Apple and Google [emphasis mine]:\n",
      "“Apple’s approach is about a dumb cloud enabling rich apps while Google’s is about devices as dumb glass that are endpoints of cloud services…”\n",
      "But Google’s “dumb glass” can’t be too dumb. For its mobile advertising business, Google needs to “see” everything we do on our smartphones, just like it does on our PCs. Evans intimates as much:\n",
      "“…it seems that Google is trying to make ‘app versus web’ an irrelevant discussion — all content will act like part of the web, searchable and linkable by Google.”\n",
      "Native apps running on a “really smart” device are inimical to Google’s business model. To keep the advertisers happy, Google would have to “instrument” native apps, insert deep links that will feed its data collection activities.\n",
      "This is where the Apple vs. Google contrast is particularly significant: iOS apps are not allowed to let advertisers know what we are doing — unless explicitly authorized. Apple’s business model doesn’t rely on peddling our profile to advertisers.\n",
      "In the end, I wonder if Google really believes in the “dumb glass” approach to smartphones. Perhaps, at least for now, The Computer will remain The Computer.\n",

      "When I talk to people these days, they often say, glumly, “the world is going through a bad patch”. And if I ask them what they mean, they reply, “the bad side of people is coming out.”\n",
      "Ah. The good and the bad, the dark and the light. In our tiny mental model of emotions, of mind, of people, we seem to weigh these things equally. As if people have two hearts, or two sides to a heart, each perfectly balancing the other on the scales of the soul. And yet. Something feels like it’s missing in that way of thinking, isn’t it?\n",
      "By a dark side, we mean: our anger, fear, shame, guilt. Our impulses to hurt and to harm, others and ourselves. Those emotions that we conveniently call “negative”, because they imply suffering. Yet there is something very different about the light and the dark in us. The dark is an effect. It is caused. It is always a result of something. Sometimes, it’s a result of childhood trauma. More often, I think, it’s the consequence of little hurts and harms, planted like seeds, in the soil of time. Either way, darkness is something given.\n",
      "Darkness in this sense isn’t real. It has no substance, reality, fundament. Because it’s caused, effected, it’s unnatural. Our fear and guilt and shame and anger are in this way the falsest parts of us. They are not really human nature at all — and that is one of the greatest mistakes that Western philosophy makes.\n",
      "Now, of course, darkness doesn’t feel that way. It feels like the most real thing of all. When you are suffering, when you are wracked by depression, guilt, shame, anger, nothing could be more alive. After all, they feel more alive than you, and their point often seems to to be to kill you.\n",
      "I’ve been there, you know. I talk about economics, changing the world, doing good and noble things. Abstractions, numbers, equations. I built a wall for a long time to keep people out, and those were the bricks. But in every little cave, darkness laughs and blooms. If I think back on my life, the darkness was right there in me, too. It whispered unkind things in a sweet, kind voice: “Give up. You’re not good enough. You’re a failure.” And so on. Maybe you’re surprised to hear it, in some way. Ah, but that’s the trick the darkness plays on us, isn’t it?\n",
      "The darkness stops us from seeing. That’s why it’s there. We need it, more than we think, suppose, know. In that darkness, then we can twist and shape people into whatever we need. Heroes, monsters, scapegoats, villains. I think of all the things I’ve been made into. All of those and worse. You can think of all the things that you’ve been made into. That’s why you and I need the darkness. Because the light is even more painful, sometimes. It shows us the truth, the reality, the essence. Then we really see a person, naked, in all their fragility and humility and brokenness.\n",
      "The darkness hides all that. We don’t see broken things in the darkness. Have you ever noticed? We only see wholes. We see teeth and claws and eyes, which we join together into fearsome illusions. We see angels and demons and promised lands and heavens and hells and all the rest of it.\n",
      "And so what we don’t see is the truest thing of all. The broken heart right in front of us. It’s exactly like ours. Only the cracks are in different places. Have you ever tried to find a little crack at midnight? That is exactly what the darkness is there to hide.\n",
      "Darkness produces darkness, in this truest way. We go blind. And then there is more darkness. We fall at the feet of our heroes, looking for salvation. We curse the monsters, in fury. The wheel of suffering turns. No true healing or growing or living happens, because no truth has happened.\n",
      "Only the cracks are different. Every heart is broken. That’s the truth of this life. Perhaps you suppose that’s a strange and sad thing to say. I think it’s a liberating one. I would rather see the pain in you than the happiness in you, and if you tell me that pain isn’t there, then I will know that you don’t want me to see you at all. And if I see the pain in you, only then can I really know the happiness in you. The opposite is false, isn’t it?\n",
      "Maybe that sounds abstract to you. It did to me, once. I think that if you really go into yourself, for just a moment, and just let go, then maybe you can experience something different. Something in you that is fundamental, real, true. You can ask yourself: “where did all these harmful feelings in me come from? Was I born with them? They were caused, produced. And their only purpose is to stop me from seeing people. What exactly, precisely are they trying to stop me from seeing?” Then you see with the witness in you. Not go blind from the darkness that was given to you.\n",
      "Here’s a secret. We don’t fight darkness with light. We don’t fight darkness at all, really. We only see through it. We see the source with the witness. Another darkness, a deeper darkness. We see the suffering that caused our suffering. We see the pain that lashed into our pain. We see all that, in some way, reflected in every broken heart standing before us — instead of never seeing those cracks at all. Then we suddenly experience something truer, something impossible, something beautiful, something vast. That we are all one even in this way. We are bound by darkness, just as we are bound by light.\n",
      "And then, at last, we are free.\n",

    "In our next model we will use the vocabulary to build our prediction model. We will implement a the Bag-of-Words algorithm. Bag-of-Words is a very simple but often surprisingly effective algorithm. It takes all the different words in a training set and uses them as features. Each article is then transformed into a feature vector by marking the occurrence of each feature (=word). There are a few variations of Bag-of-Words. In it's basic form each vector counts the number of occurrences for each word. This is what we are going to use in this model 3. In the next section (model 4) will use the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) approach to build the Bag-of-Words vectors.\n",

    "The code cell below defines a number of functions. The approach to define functions vs. directly executed code cells has been choosen to make the code reuseable for the next model in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the training, predicting and scoring functionalties the code implementes two additional capabilities: 1.) it allows trained classifiers to be saved to or loaded from disk. This saves time when the Notebook is run multiple times. The model needs to be trained only once. 2.) The model can be trained with different classifiers. During experiementation very often different classifiers (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree, SVM) are tested to evaluate which one is most suitable for a problem."

In our case the number of 63,021 dimensions (= features) is significantly higher than the 5,756 samples (= number of training articles). Perhaps, because in our case the number of dimensions is almost ten times the number of samples make SVM unsuitable for our problem. The SVM library in scikit learn offers options for optimisation such as various classifiers (SVC, NuSVC and LinearSVC) and different kernel functions.

Also, John Westenberg has been misclassified six times as Gary Vaynerchuk. The examples show that misclassification can be concentrated to a few classes. With this confusion matrices can provided valuable cues that are helpful for further fine tuning models."

    "With all the code for Model 3 developed with reusability in mind, we can now quickly implement another model that utilizes the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) approach. In TFIDF, similar to word count, each word represents a feature. Each word is assigned a weight factor that is higher the more often a word occurs in an article. However, at the same time the weight of a word is reduced the more often it occurs across other articles. The idea behind TFIDF is that words that occur more across multiple articles carry less meaning then specialized words that occur within a smaller number of articles.\n",

    "The performance of the TFIDF model with logistic regression is almost identical to the word count model described in the previous section. The TFIDF of words doesn't help to increase the accuracy in predicting the author. This can be explained by the fact that authors most probably write about specific topics (e.g. entrepreneurship, astrophysics). With this we can expect a high frequency of key topic words within the articles from the same author but less so across all articles in the training set. This in turn means that the IDF part of TFIDF has less impact on the learning. Which then means the TFIDF gets closer to what the word count does."

    "Another approach to numerically represent meaning in text is offered by using word embeddings. Word embedding algorithms such as Word2Vec and GloVe aim to find similar representations for words with similar meanings. Individual words are represented by vectors with tens or several hundred dimensions. These vectors are learned by processing a large amount of text through a neural network. During learning, the algorithm learns the embedding either by predicting the current word based on its context or by predicting the surrounding words given a current word. The result of the embeddings learning phase is a set of vectors where words with similar meanings have similar vectors. Essentially \"similarness\" is represented by the distance between word vectors. The vector representations of words with similar meanings have shorter distances between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years word embedding approaches have been one of the key breakthroughs in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this promising outlook we will test the word embeddings approach on our problem in the following two models. Model 8 will learn word embeddings as part of the convolutional neural network (CNN). In model 9 we will use pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very helpful resource for this topic was the book \"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, Develop Deep Learning Models for Natural Language in Python\" from Jason Brownlee. From this book  (page 163) the CNN used in this model has been taken. The model has been modified to a multiclass classifier (original model was a binary classifier for sentiment analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key learning from implementing this model: The `one_hot` function from the `keras.preprocessing.text` library was originally used to convert the words in articles to integer values. This was done as preparation to train the CNN. However, `one_hot` does not encode collision free. During testing it has been found that against a text corpus with 54,619 unique words `one_hot` caused 22,793 collisions. Meaning 22,793 integers were not uniquely mapped to single words. It is believed that this high proportion of collisions significantly distorts the learning of the embedding CNN. To resolve this issue function `learn_vocabulary` has been implemented (see below)."

    "When predicting authors based on word embeddings learned from scratch we achieve a prediction accuracy on the test data of 13.18% (please note, results vary significantly with different runs of this notebook). This is a very low prediction accuray. This can be explained by the fact that the word embeddings were learned from only 5,756 articles (around 3.5 million words/tokens). Word embeddings are algorithms that require large amount of training data to properly learn relationships between words. Available pre-trained word embeddings were trained on significantly larger text corpora. For example the GloVe word embeddings file [glove.6B.zip](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) contains 6 billion tokens and a vocabulary of 400,000 words and was trainind on the Wikipedia corpus.\n",

    "It is interesting to see that the good old logistic regression classifier in model 3 has achieved a prediction accuracy of 92.55%. With that it has significantly outperformed all other classification approaches. This is a good reminder that, even with todays state of the art algorithms, it's always worth to look into simpler algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the more sophisticated models 8 & 9 with word embeddings and CNNs didn't perform better, is probably because of the small size of training data available. Word embeddings require large volumes of training data to pick up the relationship between individual words. For the problem addressed in this project, predicting the authorship of a given text, the amount of training data will always be very limited. As shown in section [Exploring the Data Set](#Exploring the Data Set) the most active authors have produced a few hundred articles. Only six have produced 1,000 and more articles. If an application needs to be developed that needs to classify articles into topic categories (sport, gardening , science, ....) then the amount of training data will definitely be much higher as much more authors will write about the same topic. This would make the word embeddings approach worthwhile to revisit. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthwhile to note that model 2 achieved a prediction accuracy above 30%. This model was build only on features reflecting the number of words in articles, paragraphs and sentences. The model does not take anything of the article content into account. In future improvements this model might be used as part of an ensemble learner to improve the prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development of this notebook some effort has been put into refactoring the code with re-usability in mind. Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for testing approaches and algorithms. Once a promising model has been identified, it is expected that a notebook like this will be handed over to an implementation developer who will transform the code into something that can be shipped to production. Models 3 - 9 have been implemented as Python classes with a consistent interface providing `train`, `predict` and `score` methods. Pre-processing activities have been \"packaged\" into separate functions which supports reuse and, hopefully, code readability. It is believed that instilling a \"production usable\" mindset in machine learning engineers will benefit the quick transition of new ideas into usable applications. The last section in this notebook demonstrates the simplicity with which the successful model 3 can be used in a simple application.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important learning from this project is to keep an eye on testing the different stages of the machine learning pipeline. For all of the models discussed above the raw text from the articles had to be transformed in several stages in order to be used with a classifier or a neural network. The initial text cleaning tasks (removal of punctuation and stop words, stemming, transform all words to lowercase) are fairly straightforward and can be validated by a simple visual inspection of a few samples. It gets a bit more tricky when text is transformed into numbers such as word counts or, even more so, integers that act as pointers to word vectors. Are the numbers I now see are integer indexes or still the word counts from the model I tried earlier? Am I sure that each word/token has now been encoded with its unique integer value? The challenge with machine learning implementation is that bugs not necessarily manifest themselves in hard stops of the code. How do you know whether the reported prediction accuracy of X% is because of the limits of the model or because of a bug in your vectorization code? To address this it is worthwhile for machine learning engineers to be mindful about testability of the different stages of a machine learning system."
