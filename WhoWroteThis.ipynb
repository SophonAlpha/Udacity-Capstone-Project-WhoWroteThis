    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow the system to learn the writing characteristics of different authors we require a dataset that provides a large number of articles for individual authors. There are rich datasets for NLP research available in the public domain. A list, as an example, can be found [here](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets). However, as part of this project we will build our own dataset. We will develop a web scraper that will collect articles from the publishing platform Medium. The articles on Medium seem to be reasonably long (at least several hundred words). There are enough authors that have published several hundreds articles. With this, it appears feasible to acquire a large enough data set to learn patterns in the writing characteristics to distinguish between individual authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has been chosen as an opportunity to develop practical experience not only in machine learning but also around data acquisition. In data science and machine learning the acquisition and preparation of high quality data is often the bigger challenge than the actual development of the machine learning system itself. In \"[Datasets Over Algorithms](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26587)\" author Alexander Wissner-Gross notes that \n",
    "\n",
    ">*\"the average elapsed time between key [machine learning] algorithm proposals and corresponding advances was about eighteen years, whereas the average elapsed time between key dataset availabilities and corresponding advances was less than three years, or about six times faster, suggesting that datasets might have been limiting factors in the advances.\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently the website [Top Authors](https://topauthors.xyz/) has published a list of 300+ top Medium authors. The project folder contains the short script `get_list_of_Medium_authors.py` that has been used to extract the Medium URL for each author. The initial list of 300+ authors has been reduced to 25. The criteria for this reduction was the number of published articles. For the 25 authors there are at least 300 articles available. The Medium URLs for these authors can be found in file `Medium_authors_25.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook/Top Authors.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "<center>*getting a list of Medium \n",
    "authors*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual collection of the articles is done with the script `pull_Medium_articles.py`. The script performs two steps. First, it builds a list of all article URLs and for each article saves author URL and article URL in JSON format in the file `Medium_article_urls.json`. Below is an example how the entries for three articles look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@tedr/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch/etiquette-and-the-cancer-patient-630a50047448?source=user_profile---------1----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@esterbloom/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/the-billfold/failing-at-shoplifting-life-with-kesha-bc2600b1f440?source=user_profile---------789----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@gassee/latest\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://mondaynote.com/the-ny-times-un-free-at-last-df2eddba360b?source=user_profile---------281----------------\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part performs the actual download of the articles. The script reads the article URL saved in `Medium_article_urls.json`, navigates to the website and reads the text information from the html code of the article website. Each article is saved in text format in its own file. For each author a folder is generated that contains the articles for that author. Initially it was intended to store all articles in JSON format in one file. This turned out to be very cumbersome when troubleshooting the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script. Having a folder structure that allows to do quick visual inspections over the list of files in a file manager proved very helpful. In addition, the smaller article files made it easier to spot check the downloaded text information in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "During research for this project several Python libraries for interacting with websites have been explored: [mechanize](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/0.3.6), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#), [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). Eventually the decision was made to use the Selenium WebDriver. The key reason for this was: the Medium website uses a two step login process. The users provides its email address and then receives a one time login link via this email. That made it difficult to automate the login via script and ruled out all the libraries that don't allow user interaction with the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an article website is loaded, the required information can be pulled from the text attribute of specific html elements. The code snipped below shows the commands used to get the author name and the article text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "author = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//a[@rel=\"author cc:attributionUrl\"]').text\n",
    "body = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//div[@class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\"]').text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the code snippet above the right elements are addressed by their respective xpath. Finding these xpaths required a bit of trail and error. A valuable tool for this is the FireFox Inspector. It allows to inspect the code and structure of a website and to find the right path to the right html element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top Authors](notebook\\Firefox Inspector.jpg)\n",
    "<center>*finding the right xpath with Firefox Inspector*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script completed, the folder `Medium_articles` containing all article files has been compressed into a ZIP archive to preserve storage. With [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) Python provides a library to work with ZIP archives. Going forward in this Notebook we will make use of this library to work with the files directly within the ZIP archive without the need to extract the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a web scraper script poses its own challenges. The initial idea is pretty straightforward: here is a list of URLs, go to each website, download the text part and save it in a file. As always, the pitfalls are discovered during implementation. Some time had to be invested to understand the structure of the Medium article websites and figure out the best way to find the right html elements that contain the required information. The Selenium WebDriver is not the most effective tool when it comes to scraping several thousand websites. The time to render each and every website adds up. An attempt has been made by parallelising the article download with multi-threading and spawning of several instances of the Firefox browser. This failed. It turned out that the fast sequence of websites caused Firefox to slowly consume all available memory and eventually Firefox stopped fetching new websites. In a parallelised version of the script the problem was only exaggerated. Finally, a pragamatic approach was taken and the script has been amended with the capability to continue the work where it has left off from a previous run. Over the course of several days the script has been restarted several times and eventually saved all articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In defense for Selenium, it needs to be noted that Selenium first and foremost is a tool to automate testing of websites and not a tool for scaping several thousand websites. The primary goal behind the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script was to get the data for this capstone project and not to develop a sophisticated web scraper. In this respect Selenium did the job. Despite the challenges, developing the web scraper script has been a worthwhile learing experience. It provided an opportunity to develop practical experience not only in machine learning but also around data acquisition.\n",

      "< 1) nature. This is a big one! Sure, inflation generically predicts that these fluctuations should be scale-invariant. But there’s a slight caveat, or a correction to that: the shape of the inflationary potentials that work — their slopes and concavities — affect how the spectrum of fluctuations departs from perfect scale invariance. The two simplest classes of inflationary models, new inflation and chaotic inflation, give predictions for n_s that typically cover the range between 0.92 and 0.98.\n",
      "And finally, a Universe with a particular spectrum of gravitational wave fluctuations. This is the last one, and the only major one that hasn’t yet been confirmed. Some models — like the simple chaotic inflation model — give large-magnitude gravitational waves (the kind that could’ve been seen by BICEP2), while others, like the simple new inflation model, can give very small-magnitude gravitational waves.\n",
      "Image credit: ESA and the Planck Collaboration.\n",
      "Over the past 35 years, we’ve made incredible, all-sky measurements of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, from scales as large as the entire visible Universe down to angular resolutions of a mere 0.07°. As space-based satellites became more and more capable over time — COBE in the 1990s, WMAP in the 2000s, and now Planck in the 2010s — we’ve gained incredible insight into the Universe when it was less than 0.003% its current age.\n",
      "Image credit: Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including the current depth of the survey.\n",
      "Similarly, large-scale structure surveys have become incredibly ubiquitous, with some covering the entire sky and others covering huge patches at even greater depths. With the Sloan Digital Sky Survey providing the best modern data sets, we’ve been able to confirm the first five of these six predictions, placing inflation on a very firm footing.\n",
      "The Universe is observed to be exactly spatially flat — with a curvature of 1, exactly — to a precision of 1.0007 ± 0.0025, as best shown by the large-scale structure of the Universe.\n",
      "The fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background show a Universe with scales that extend up to and beyond the horizon of the observable Universe.\n",
      "The maximum temperature that our Universe ever could have achieved, as shown by the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, is only ~10^16 GeV, or a factor of 1,000 smaller than a non-inflationary Universe.\n",
      "The types of fluctuations the Universe was born with, to the best of our measurements, are 100% adiabatic, and 0% isocurvature. The correlations between the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the Universe show this, although this wasn’t confirmed until the early 2000s.\n",
      "And from the latest data from the most advanced cosmic microwave background satellite, Planck, gives us a scalar spectral index (which comes from the densityfluctuations) that’s not only less than 1, it’s precisely measured to be n_s = 0.968 ± 0.006.\n",
      "That last number, n_s, is really, really important if we want to look for the sixth and final prediction of inflation: gravitational wave fluctuations.\n",
      "Image credit: NASA / WMAP science team.\n",
      "The spectrum of fluctuations in the microwave background looks like the squiggled line, above, today, but it grew out of the interplay of all the different forms of energy over time, from the end of inflation until the Universe was 380,000 years old. It grew from the density fluctuations at the end of inflation: the horizontal line. Only, that line isn’t quite horizontal; there’s a slight tilt to the line, and the slope represents the departure of spectral index, n_s, from 1.\n",
      "The reason this is important is that inflation makes a specific prediction for a special ratio (r), where r is the ratio of the gravitational wave fluctuations to the scalar spectral index, n_s. For the two main classes of inflationary models — as well as in other models — there is a huge disparity in what r is predicted to be.\n",
      "Image credit: Kamionkowski and Kovetz, to appear in ARAA, 2016, from http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1510.06042. Results presented at AAS227.\n",
      "For chaotic models, r is typically very large: no smaller than about 0.01, where 1 is the maximum conceivable value. But for the new inflation models,r can vary from as large as about 0.05 down to tiny, minuscule numbers like 10^–60! But these various r values are often correlated with specific values for ns, as you can see above. If n_s turns out to actually be the value that we’ve best measured it to be right now — 0.968 — then the simplest models you can write down for both chaotic inflation and new inflation only give values of r that are bigger than about 10^–3.\n",
      "As reported by Mark Kamionkowski in his talk at AAS (and based on his paper here), all the simple models one can write down, for the measured value of n_s, means that r can’t range from 10^–60 to 1; it can only range from 10^–3 to 1. And this could be very, very problematic in short order, because there are a whole host of ground-based surveys that are measuring the type of signal that can measure r, already constrained to be less than 0.09, if it’s greater than or equal to ~10^–3.\n",
      "Image credit: Kamionkowski and Kovetz, to appear in ARAA, 2016, from http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1510.06042. Results presented at AAS227.\n",
      "The gravitational wave fluctuations produced by inflation cause both E-mode and B-mode polarizations, but the density fluctuations (and ns) show up in only the E-modes. So if you measure the B-mode polarizations, you can learn about the gravitational wave fluctuations and determine r!\n",
      "This is what experiments such as BICEP2, POLARBEAR, SPTPOL and SPIDER, among others, are working to measure right now. There are B-mode polarization signals caused by lensing effects, but if the inflationary fluctuations are larger than r ~ 0.001, they’ll be able to be seen in 5–10 years by the experiments running and planned to run over that time.\n",

      "In that article I linked to I outline the difference between gross margin & net margin. Gross margin (GM) is the amount of profit you make per sale of your product or service taking into account your total costs of selling that product or service. If you have a very low gross margin (10–30%) it can be very hard to build a large, scalable business because you need to make a lot of sales to cover your operating costs. Some industries work well with players who have low gross margins but these tend to be industries with very large, well established players and hard for new entrants to compete. In startup world low GM almost always equals death which is why many Internet retailers have failed or are failing (many operated at 35% gross margins).\n",

It’s why some journalists enthusiastically declare, “Company X is doing $20 million in revenue” (when said company might be just selling somebody else’s physical product) and think that is necessarily good while in fact that might be much worse than a company doing $5 million in sales (but who might be selling software whose sales are extremely profitable).\n",
      "But the biggest thing to know is this: Companies who are scaling quickly in revenue and with a high gross margin often should invest as much capital in growth as they can manage responsibly because when you find a product / market fit and your company is growing at a very fast scale you want to capture market share before competition sets in. Think DropBox, Airbnb, Uber, Maker Studios. Your goal is to invest in engineering (to maintain your product lead), new offices / locations (to capture markets before others), marketing (to capture consumer attention before others do) … all of these activities consume cash often in advance of the revenue they generate.\n",
      "For 2+ years I had to listen to market pundits talking about Maker Studios “losing so much money” while we were growing > 200% / year compounded.\n",
      "But this strategy great depends on point 3.\n",
      "3. Availability of Capital\n",
      "The simple truth is that there is no one answer to the question “how much should a startup burn” and thus the advice that Danielle gives in her post (which is very valuable if you’re at her stage and have raised capital in they way she has) is really “how much should a startup without a strong VC lead and without a strong balance sheet (read: not a lot of cash in the bank) burn.\n",
      "In these kinds of businesses I’m on the record as advising “Ring the Freakin Cash Register.” Stay lean and only raise a big round if you DO find product / market fit and which point you want to loosen the belt quickly and raise the capital to do so.\n",
      "If you have strong VC support now and a lot of cash in the bank you may be willing to accept a higher burn rate (say $300k or $400k per month) than a company with angel money and less cash in the bank. If you’re growing very, very fast and you’ve raised $40 million it is not crazy to think you might burn net $1 million / month (>\n",

      "While the cost of education and it’s inherent value in society are a matter of great debate, the question of whether it is the only thing that affects one’s opportunity, especially as a Person of Color is not.\n",
      "But this is not as easy to discern an answer to, especially if you are working from the premise of America being a “post-racial” society and the conceptual baggage that “we are all equal once we are all equally educated.”\n",
      "For clarity’s sake let’s put it out there: America is not “post racial” and shan’t be so any time soon. So any conversation regarding equality in employment already suffers from perception issues and “implicit bias” no matter what field of endeavor one works in.\n",
      "By definition, implicit bias is an unconscious negative evaluation or association that gets incorporated into one’s mental representation of a particular concept (be it a person, group, place, event, object, idea, value, etc.). What’s particularly insidious about implicit bias is that it does not depend on (and often occurs in spite of) an explicit endorsement or intention to have a negative attitude toward a particular target. (1)\n",
      "Here’s my completed answer which could not fit within the 4000 character limitation:\n",
      "Everyone here is right. Everyone here is wrong. A degree matters. Certifications can also matter. Experience matters and trumps everything no matter what you’ve been told.\n",
      "The problem isn’t whether a degree is better or whether certifications and experience are better. Each has its value depending on what the person doing the hiring BELIEVES matters.\n",
      "I shall use myself as an example: My career in IT spans three decades, starting as a lowly technician, repairing parts in electronic systems, to working with primitive workstations, to desktop design (before it was called that), helpdesk support, computer aided design, computer programming, system maintenance, network design and engineering, teaching computer science, IT manager, IT director, Chief Information Officer (at 39), and VP of Information Systems.\n",
      "I have no computer science degree. I have an English degree. I have held half a dozen certifications, CCNA, CCNP, A+, Network+, MCSE, etc, but none of those things got me the jobs I applied for, because I didn’t brag on them, or use them as leverage. Why?\n",
      "Because no one cares about how much you know, until they know how much you care.\n",
      "What got me my jobs was my unswerving ability to let people know I was interested in their issues and I could find solutions to their problems. It was not just the hard skills of computer technology management, which I certainly had, but the soft skills of dealing with their fears and implicit bias which made it possible for me to have opportunities at all.\n",
      "My other concession to dealing with implicit bias was talking to companies whose impossible standards, as set by their HR job descriptions, were designed to keep people out of the workplace, not invite them in. Such jobs are meant as gatekeeping devices since those companies prefer to hire from within or from already existing lists of candidates and are only posting those jobs as a legal formality.\n",
      "You see, today’s climate is less interested in hiring People of Color, I am certain you have all noticed it. It’s called “implicit bias”. Compare the unemployment rate of African Americans to any other social group and you will find equally qualified candidates but double the unemployment rate among People of Color in comparison.\n",
      "For example, when it comes to implicit racial bias, many people who genuinely and legitimately consider themselves to be non-prejudiced and committed to egalitarianism at a conscious level could, at the same time, hold a negative association toward individuals of another race at an implicit level. (1)\n",
      "If we assume equal levels of qualification, education, degree and experience, only the implicit bias can make sense for a 5.6% among Whites and a 11.7% among equally qualified African American employees. Depending on where you live, these may be very generous percentages. Some states are significantly higher in both groups but always in parity to the percentages I’ve mentioned.\n",
      "When White America suffers unemployment, its like having a summer cold. It soon passes, and they are usually none the worse for the wear. When Black America suffers unemployment, its akin to a new flu sweeping through the community.\n",
      "We have it longer, it’s more debilitating and many of us may die waiting for its symptoms to abate. The crippling effects can last for decades as we struggle to recover from the loss of income, homes and opportunities now shifting due to policy and implicit bias affecting our community.\n",
      "Woe be unto the African American community when White America suffers a debilitating disease like the one created from the 2008 economic crisis, its effects on the African American community may reverberate for generations.\n",
      "The way the system is structured now, the code words of “being a match for the culture” and “being the right fit” are simply the new way of discriminating and deciding who will work where.\n",
      "The new racism is more subtle: The powers-that-be no longer have to say “no”. They can pre-screen you through their use of today’s information technology. Your online footprint, your writing, your photographs, your credit report, all of these things are used now as a means of deciding IF you fit a particular cultural standard set by the predominately White workforce.\n",
      "I will lose many readers by this point. The frustration with talking about implicit bias is no one wants to admit they suffer from it. So readers will turn away and say: “This article is bullshit and I don’t want to deal with this. I need an article that will inspire me to… <insert rationale here>. Anything other than hearing where I work isn’t treating People of Color equally. It’s not my problem.”\n",
      "Such unconscious biases could originate from any number of sources, one of the most likely culprits being repeated exposure to stereotypical depictions or prejudicial attitudes toward individuals of another race in one’s personal life (e.g., growing up constantly hearing racist views or jokes expressed by others at home or school) or in the broader culture (e.g., seeing caricatured representations of a group’s members in films or TV shows). (1)\n",
      "And that’s okay too. I expect as much. If you are uncomfortable reading this, the problem is you, not me. You see, I’ve accepted the system the way it is. I recognize the struggles of Whites seeking to remain in power in a world where their numbers are diminishing, their hegemony is challenged by other nations which are not predominately White (China, India, South America, the Pan-African continent) and the fear of a world where they no longer dominate the media, control the news, present the world in movies as one where they are both the heroes and the victims will eventually come to a close.\n",
      "To forestall that inevitable time, they are shoring up their ranks, focusing on their opportunities and making sure they and their progeny have every advantage their current system can set up. From controlling voting to pricing people out of the ability to get a quality education without going into bankruptcy. This isn’t an accident.\n",
      "It isn’t even malicious. It is business as usual. The powers-that-be no longer recognize what they do as bias. They simply see it as perpetuating the world the way it has always been for them.\n",
      "For us, as People of Color, railing against that system is normal and necessary but they have created a world where overt racism and bias are not used any longer. Like Klan hoods and cross burning, such tools of intimidation are no longer necessary.\n",
      "The new system doesn’t have to say “no” to you to oppress you or limit your opportunities. They just don’t have to say “yes”.\n",
      "Applications for work vanish into the black hole that is the new data-driven HR department, outsourced for “improved efficiency”. The use of modern technology allows them to refute you without even having to acknowledge your existence. Your qualifications are second to that. It’s a hard truth, especially if you went into debt for your education.\n",
      "Education matters less than your ability to sell yourself to potential employers. You must wrestle with implicit bias, the socialized and accepted concept that People of Color and technology do not belong together.\n",
      "Not true, you say?\n",
      "If we have learned nothing from the reveal of Google, Facebook, and Twitter and many other tech firms it is this: Such companies have gone out of their way to hide the fact they are not interested in hiring US, no matter our qualifications. Using the old chestnuts of “we can’t seem to find qualified applicants” and the like, we make up less than 2% of those tech company ranks, despite our obvious abundance if you are truly looking.\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO — Top universities turn out black and Hispanic computer science and computer engineering graduates at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them, a USA TODAY analysis shows. Technology companies blame the pool of job applicants for the severe shortage of blacks and Hispanics in Silicon Valley.\n",
      "But these findings show that claim “does not hold water,” said Darrick Hamilton, professor of economics and urban policy at The New School in New York.\n",
      "“What do dominant groups say? ‘We tried, we searched but there was nobody qualified.’ If you look at the empirical evidence, that is just not the case,” he said.(2)\n",
      "What’s the takeaway? Like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and so many others who (being blessed with that winning complexion and substantial parental wealth) coupled with ruthless ambition, they were able to make a way for themselves, drawing people to their banner by whatever means necessary, despite their lack of educational credentials. Read their histories and learn HOW they did what they did.\n",
      "But don’t do it. We shouldn’t be turning on each other to make opportunity, there are too few of us.\n",
      "We should be turning toward each other to discover how we can complement our skills, education and experiences with like-minded individuals who are seeking the same future we are; an opportunity to use our abilities to the fullest, participating in society as contributing members whose primary concern shouldn’t be: Is my degree enough to get me a job?\n",
      "It shouldn’t be the question at all. It wasn’t for Bill Gates. But you don’t have his options.\n",
      "We have to think about the long game. What is happening in the world, what is needed, how can my skills, such as they are, position me to be in the right space at the right time, so that when I see an opening, I am the logical candidate or in a position to lead and become CEO in my own right.\n",
      "We will have to make our own opportunities, make them competitive before we can be recognized as being equal. Harsh, but true. Embrace it.\n",
      "When you have your own, you get to decide what you will do, and bear all the responsibility for those choices. Until you become your own CEO, you must make opportunities for yourself to LEARN from your experiences.\n",
      "Experience trumps education, the same way knowledge trumps data. If you can’t apply it, then it has no intrinsic value. In information technology, experience has a flavor and capacity all its own. Education is nice but it does not replace doing the work. It adds a great theoretical background but won’t replace getting in there and learning by doing.\n",
      "This is why social media makes money though it produces nothing. It is the ability to apply value to data and then sell it to those who can utilize it to their economic benefit. Social media, hell almost ANY media isn’t for you. It’s for the people who profit from utilizing your information for their benefit.\n",
      "The modern workforce demands adaptability more than anything else. You must be able to learn what’s new and how it finds a place in the greater scheme of things. You must have the vision to see what is and discern what will be.\n",
      "Being educated is good. But without vision, a man is lost. He is a learned fool wandering the Earth, wondering why things only seem to happen when he isn’t around. With vision, we take control of what is served before us, such as it is. No matter what it is, vision gives us the capacity to turn it into something useful.\n",
      "Define the world, understand its workings, adapt yourself to the things you believe are your strengths, achieve mastery in those which suit your ambitions ignoring the rest, create your opportunities from your vision and experiences. Never assume what works for someone else will work for you. Your greatest tool is the ability to imagine the world the way it should be, not accepting it for what it is.\n",
      "This is the recipe you’ve been looking for. The doors open when your mastery is irrefutable. If they don’t those were places that were not meant for you and they never would be, no matter your “credentials”.\n",

      "<no last name> will ferry our trio in the temporal escapade: Timeless.\n",
      "Granted, this is only a trailer but it left me asking: Will I devote a single second of my considerable love of time travel stories to this?\n",
      "Do I need another tale of a Black character impotently driving the other heroes of the stories to places he will almost assuredly find himself arrested, called boy or other colorful terms I simply despise so much?\n",
      "Look: A trailer. Go ahead and watch it and see if you can see what I am talking about…\n",
      "Is Rufus a scientist on the project? The trailer didn’t say so. It established the bone fides of the other characters early while he is seen saying the only thing we can both agree on in this story: “I am Black. There is literally no place in American history that will be awesome for me.”\n",
      "I have said those exact words as to why I study history and would find a time machine to the past to be the last thing I would want for a Christmas present.\n",
      "Why am I down on this series, sight unseen?\n",
      "(To be fair, I may watch the pilot and revise my perspectives totally assuming I can make it past this preview…)\n",
      "Because, there is no era in American history more rife with racial FUCKERY than the period of 1901–1968. More historical movies promoting American greatness while ignoring America atrocity exist in this period than in almost any other.\n",
      "Movies about World War I and II as well as period piece set in this time have always been a Hollywood favorite because they don’t have to employ many (read as ANY) people of color to appear on the screen.\n",
      "America promotes the ideals of democracy and liberty while forcing Black Americans to be segregated and support the war effort as “logistical agents.” American history is also rife with opportunities lost to tell those very same tales of Black heroes excelling despite this overt racism.\n",
      "I think movies set in these periods even eclipses the movie-going audiences engineered thirst for SLAVERY movies because they can happily say when casting: “There just weren’t any indications that people of color would have been present in these period pieces due to the self-segregation of Negros into their own neighborhoods and cultures. Thus we don’t have to worry about representation because everyone agrees that Blacks weren’t involved in anything historic at that time and movie history proves it.”\n",
      "In slave narratives, they have to actually employ people of color AS SLAVES which undermines their chief socialized narrative: “Black people have never done anything for America we couldn’t do for ourselves.”\n",
      "Such slave narrative empower the idea of representation of Blacks in media, no matter how derogatorily they are depicted, because in this way, they are said to have existed in American history.\n",
      "I have always suspected it is this reason that such movies had fallen from favor for quite some time. The mindset had become: “If you acknowledge they were slaves, you acknowledge we MIGHT owe them something.

      "I worked for the Imperial Navy. I went into service over five thousand Standard Years ago. I had traveled to distant corners of the Imperium and over the years collected a tale or two, spun a few more and now most recently had become part of one or two. That happened if you live long enough, were good enough at your job and sought advancement with vigor.\n",
      "When I retired, I began to work in medical trade and transfer. No matter where you go, if its alive, then sooner or later it will get sick. Except for the Foilians, who made of pure silicon, could make the claim they never got sick. For the rest of us, there were old-timers like me who, while now no longer capable of serving on the front line, could still help the ever-growing Imperium.\n",

      "<’STRATUM FIELD COLLAPSING>\n",
      "The last run was a long jump from one end of the Imperium to the other. Long jumps are tricky because you travel in the substratum of C space, avoiding limitations such as the C Barrier. This substratum is vulnerable to the drive technology we use allowing ships to drop into this space, temporarily allowing us to exceed the speed of light. This is the relevant part, we discovered our stardrives affect the ‘Stratum causing disruptions we will eventually called warp storms. These disruptions are temporal, resetting local reality, or making voidships disappear altogether.\n",
      "Travel through the void as it was called, became more regulated and technologies developed to see and detect warp storms. Like real storms however, it was an imperfect science. Our mission of mercy was caught by a rogue wave and flung back into C space. Our causality drive down, we would be restricted to C space and nearly three hundred years of travel to return home.\n",
      "I have held the crew in stasis for over two hundred years. Of the original sixty crew members fourteen remain. The captain and first officer died twenty seven years ago and I assumed command of the mission. With only periodic wakings for course corrections, the crew would have to remain in stasis for another twenty five before we cross back into Imperial Space.\n",
      "Our life support and stasis generation hardware was rated for two hundred years of superluminal performance. It was never designed for this type of sublight journey. I estimate at the rate of failure, only I will make the trip home.\n",

      "His fellow crewmen looked stunned at each other as the previous reality folded itself into their current consciousnesses. Each absorbed their eventual fates, most with dignity, a few in horror, and one or two sobs could be heard in the mess hall.\n",
      "Even the voidship itself grew quiet, its powerful engines which could always be felt thrumming through the walls, pondered its decisions in that fateful future. Being the only survivor of a mission is never good.\n",
      "The PA system coughs before a gravelly voice filled the air of the voidship. “This is the captain speaking. The last medical delivery we were about to take into Lorencian space has been cancelled. I know many of you have family there, but it is… inadvisable for us to go. Another causality run will be attempted by another crew in two weeks.”\n",
      "He paused before continuing. “Please report to medical if you have experienced any shock or trauma you want to talk about due to recent causality. All crew are granted two weeks leave after clearance from medical staff. No off-planet travel is authorized or recommended until superposition fluctuations have settled. If you feel yourself randomly moving in spacetime, seek stabilization immediately.”\n",
      "The captain switched off his public address and stared down at his uniform. He had been in the military for nearly two hundred years, flown thousands of casualities. He had never once questioned his decision to be an officer on a voidship.\n",

      "It is pretty sad to report that all too many companies I meet struggle with clearly expressing what they are doing, how it works and why it matters. All too often I find myself in conversations where I have to ask: What is it exactly that you are doing? How does this work? Which problem does this solve again?\n",
      "Sometimes I question my own intellect — but then I see other people react with the same confused look on their faces.\n",
      "I can not stress enough how paramount it is that you can formulate a clear, concise, non-convoluted explanation of your company and what you’re doing. You don’t get points for turning your pitch into a scientific paper or a beautiful play on language. Nor does anyone give you kudos for using as many buzzwords as you can in a single sentence.\n",
      "And it has far bigger implications than just your conversations with partners and funders — if you can’t express in easy to understand words what you’re doing, how do you expect your team to be aligned? Every little blip of ambiguity makes people fill in the blanks with what they think is the right answer. Which more often than not, leads to disjunct efforts, strategy misalignment, confusion, and frustration. Not to mention that it keeps you from winning the game you’re in.\n",
      "My personal litmus test is that if I can’t explain it to the person in front of me in the line at my favorite coffee shop, it’s not clear enough. And I do test my work that way — every interaction with a new person gives me a chance to try out my pitch and see if they get it.\n",
