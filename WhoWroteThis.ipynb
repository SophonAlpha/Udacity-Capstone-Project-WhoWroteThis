    "## Project Overview <a name=\"Project Overview\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing, authors leave distinctive marks in their stories influenced by the style of their writing. Well know writers are famous for their techniques with which they express ideas and manipulate language. Erika Rasso published a well written introduction to [Famous Authors and Their Writing Styles](https://www.craftyourcontent.com/famous-authors-writing-styles/). We learn, for example, that Ernest Hemingway \"pioneered concise, objective prose in fiction—which had, up until then, primarily been used in journalism.\". Another author discussed in Rasso's article is Franz Kafka. His stories present \"surrealist, nightmarish writing in contemporary settings\" which invoke feelings of confusion and helplessness. Agatha Christie's style was influenced by \"mentions of war\". Furthermore, \"she utilized a variety of poisons to carry out the murders in her stories\". And being interested in archarology \"resulted in ancient artifacts and archaeologists being heavily featured in her novels\". A last author worthwhile to highlight here is Zora Neale Hurston. Her style is quite unique: \"She wrote in colloquial Southern dialects that mimicked the language she grew up hearing.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intuition and experience as readers tells us that the style of writing is like a \"finger print\" that differentiates authors. If we come across a text with no information about the author or a text written under a preudonym, would we be able to tell the author based of the style of writing? An interesting article about [\"Who’s At The Keyboard? Authorship Attribution in Digital Evidence Investigations\"](www.utica.edu/academic/institutes/ecii/publications/articles/B49F9C4A-0362-765C-6A235CB8ABDFACFF.pdf) has been published by Carole E. Chaski. The article discusses the question to what extend text can be attributed to an author as part of crime investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will explore to what extend machine learning techniques can learn the style of writing for a set of authors. A learned system would then be given a text not seen before and tries to predict who the author is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook has been structured in the sequential order in which the problem has been approached. The next few sections describe the data set that has been aquired and the data cleaning activities applied. This is then followed by the main section that discusses various machine learning models. The models utilise various natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. The models represent different approaches to capture the \"uniqueness\" of writing of the different authors. The key metric against which we measure each model is the accuracy in correctly predicting the authors for a set of articles that have not been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will have some fun and use the best performing model to build a small WhoWroteThis application. The user can copy and paste any text into text input field and ask the system to guess who the author is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few notes on running this Notebook:\n",

    "## Data Acquisition <a name=\"Data Acquisition\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow the system to learn the writing characteristics of different authors we require a dataset that provides a large number of articles for individual authors. There are rich datasets for NLP research available in the public domain. A list, as an example, can be found [here](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets). However, as part of this project we will build our own dataset. We will develop a web scraper that will collect articles from the publishing platform Medium. The articles on Medium seem to be reasonably long (at least several hundred words). There are enough authors that have published several hundreds articles. With this, it appears feasible to acquire a large enough data set to learn patterns in the writing characteristics to distinguish between individual authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has been chosen as an opportunity to develop practical experience not only in machine learning but also around data acquisition. In data science and machine learning the acquisition and preparation of high quality data is often the bigger challenge than the actual development of the machine learning system itself. In \"[Datasets Over Algorithms](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26587)\" author Alexander Wissner-Gross notes that \n",
    "\n",
    ">*\"the average elapsed time between key [machine learning] algorithm proposals and corresponding advances was about eighteen years, whereas the average elapsed time between key dataset availabilities and corresponding advances was less than three years, or about six times faster, suggesting that datasets might have been limiting factors in the advances.\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently the website [Top Authors](https://topauthors.xyz/) has published a list of 300+ top Medium authors. The project folder contains the short script `get_list_of_Medium_authors.py` that has been used to extract the Medium URL for each author. The initial list of 300+ authors has been reduced to 25. The criteria for this reduction was the number of published articles. For the 25 authors there are at least 300 articles available. The Medium URLs for these authors can be found in file `Medium_authors_25.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook/Top Authors.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "<center>*getting a list of Medium authors*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual collection of the articles is done with the script `pull_Medium_articles.py`. The script performs two steps. First, it builds a list of all article URLs and for each article saves author URL and article URL in JSON format in the file `Medium_article_urls.json`. Below is an example how the entries for three articles look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@tedr/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch/etiquette-and-the-cancer-patient-630a50047448?source=user_profile---------1----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@esterbloom/latest\\n\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://medium.com/the-billfold/failing-at-shoplifting-life-with-kesha-bc2600b1f440?source=user_profile---------789----------------\"}\n",
    "{\"author_URL\": \"https://medium.com/@gassee/latest\",\n",
    " \"article_URL\": \"https://mondaynote.com/the-ny-times-un-free-at-last-df2eddba360b?source=user_profile---------281----------------\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part performs the actual download of the articles. The script reads the article URL saved in `Medium_article_urls.json`, navigates to the website and reads the text information from the html code. Each article is saved in text format in its own file. For each author a folder is generated that contains the articles for that author. Initially it was intended to store all articles in JSON format in one file. This turned out to be very cumbersome when troubleshooting the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script. Having a folder structure that allows to do quick visual inspections over the list of files in a file manager proved very helpful. In addition, the smaller article files made it easier to spot check the downloaded text information in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src=\"notebook/article 1.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td>\n",
    "           <td><img src=\"notebook/article 2.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td>\n",
    "           <td><img src=\"notebook/article 3.PNG\" style=\"width: 300px\"></td></tr></table>\n",
    "<center>*Working with all these articles kept me distracted. I started reading them instead of getting on the with project.*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "During research for this project several Python libraries for interacting with websites have been explored: [mechanize](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/0.3.6), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#), [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). Eventually the decision was made to use the Selenium WebDriver. The key reason for this was: the Medium website uses a two step login process. The users provides its email address and then receives a one time login link via this email. That made it difficult to automate the login via script and ruled out all the libraries that don't allow user interaction with the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an article website is loaded, the required information can be pulled from the text attribute of specific html elements. The code snipped below shows the commands used to get the author name and the article text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "author = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//a[@rel=\"author cc:attributionUrl\"]').text\n",
    "body = self.browser.find_element_by_xpath('//div[@class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\"]').text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the code snippet above the right elements are addressed by their respective xpath. Finding these xpaths required a bit of trail and error. A valuable tool for this is the FireFox Inspector. It allows to inspect the code and structure of a website and to find the right path to the right html element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top Authors](notebook\\Firefox Inspector.jpg)\n",
    "<center>*finding the right xpath with Firefox Inspector*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script completed, the folder `Medium_articles` containing all article files has been compressed into a ZIP archive to preserve storage. With [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) Python provides a library to work with ZIP archives. Going forward in this Notebook we will make use of this library to work with the files directly within the ZIP archive without the need to extract the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a web scraper script poses its own challenges. The initial idea is pretty straightforward: here is a list of URLs, go to each website, download the text part and save it in a file. As always, the pitfalls are discovered during implementation. Some time had to be invested to understand the structure of the Medium article websites and figure out the best way to find the right html elements that contain the required information. The Selenium WebDriver is not the most effective tool when it comes to scraping several thousand websites. The time to render each and every website adds up. An attempt has been made by parallelising the article download with multi-threading and spawning of several instances of the Firefox browser. This failed. It turned out that the fast sequence of websites caused Firefox to slowly consume all available memory and eventually Firefox stopped fetching new websites. In a parallelised version of the script the problem was only exaggerated. Finally, a pragamatic approach was taken and the script has been amended with the capability to continue the work where it has left off from a previous run. Over the course of several days the script has been restarted several times and eventually saved all articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In defense for Selenium, it needs to be noted that Selenium first and foremost is a tool to automate testing of websites and not a tool for scaping several thousand websites. The primary goal behind the `pull_Medium_articles.py` script was to get the data for this capstone project and not to develop a sophisticated web scraper. In this respect Selenium did the job. Despite the challenges, developing the web scraper script has been a worthwhile learing experience. It provided an opportunity to develop practical experience around data acquisition.\n",

    "In the next section we will explore the data set. We will also check what data preparation or cleaning activities might be required before we can apply lkearning algorithms to the data set."

      "Body: When the Good Guys in Venture Change Roles\n",
      "This morning it was announced that Matt Murphy had left his role as a partner Kleiner Perkins to join as a partner in Menlo Ventures.\n",
      "As much of the coverage in the press this morning acknowledges it’s rare for a partner to leave from one firm to another. It’s even more rare for VCs to talk publicly about other VCs, so I thought it would be fun to break rank and tell you about Matt.\n",
      "I’ve worked very closely with Matt over the past four years as we share an investment in a company in Los Angeles called NextPlus and we sat on a board together for years. In this capacity I can tell any entrepreneurs raising early-stage capital that I would have Matt on my short list if I were raising. He’s had a ton of recent successes in enterprise software investments but also has a history in doing consumer deals. In fact, last time I grabbed a beer with Matt he mentioned that he had four active investments now worth over a billion in valuation.\n",
      "What did I learn in working with Matt?\n",
      "1. He’s committed. NextPlus is in LA. I watched him jump on a plane regularly to be down at all of our board meetings and while I know that sounds like an obvious commitment from a VC, I’ve watched other scenarios where NorCal VCs find reasons to always dial in via Google Hangouts or ask non-Silicon Valley investments to travel to Menlo Park or San Francisco for meetings.\n",
      "2. He’s with you in good times & bad. Gogii [the original company name] was an early leader in the free text messaging space and we had tens of millions of downloads of our product. Those were the good days. We then honestly had some quality problems in the app and while we chose the right market at the right time we didn’t emerge as the clear winner and we watched WhatsApp grow from strength to strength. This was hard on all of us. Execs at the company obviously absorbed most of the stress but it’s also not easy being on the board of a company that has so much initial success and then stumbles with problems that aren’t quick fixes.\n",
      "You hear about the proverbial Silicon Valley VC who cuts bait in tough times and moves on to other, less problematic portfolio companies. That’s not Matt. We toughed it out together with other board members and encouraged the company to rebuild the team and the product from ground up. We brought on Nanea Reeves as President to shore up quality on the product, engineering and ops side. She made an immediate positive impact on our culture, quality and overall product. We rebuilt from scratch in a year-long project that eventually re-imagined our future as less of a utility texting app and more of a fun, games-oriented app called NextPlus. Through this process we managed to maintain our millions of active users and throughout the next year we will release a series of fun, innovative products that simply weren’t possible under our old architectures. I’m personally very bullish on the future of NextPlus. It’s hard to capture a monthly active user base in mobile that spans into several millions and manage that through a transition.\n",
      "I mention all this because Matt was there for every difficult turn and decision — even though he had other successful portfolio companies and even though the company was in LA.\n",
      "3. He’s a gentleman. Ok. I know that’s old-fashioned to say but I couldn’t think of a better description for Matt. In an industry of sharp elbows, loud mouths, egos, strong opinions and short attention spans, Matt was so pleasant to work with because he was the exact opposite. He had always read all of the materials, gone through the metrics, done pre-calls with the CEO and was always respectful in how he walked through the challenges of the company and our remedies. He’s one of the truly nice guys in venture: buttoned-up and prepared.\n",
      "4. He’s knowledgable and connected. As is natural for startups not based in Silicon Valley we always relied on Matt for the, “What is everybody in the Valley seeing?” type perspective. He always had his ear to the pavement, had strong relationships into the biggest Silicon Valley tech giants and helped us navigate the tricky, changing waters of the mobile ecosystem that we went through with the early growth of iOS, the emergence of Google Play and evaluating trends at Amazon, Samsung and elsewhere. He’s been working in one of the top firms in venture capital in the Valley for many years and with that comes an enviable Rolodex. [Here is some help for the young ones if you don’t follow my old school reference ;-))\n",
      "Conclusions?\n",
      "So what about this Kleiner to Menlo switch? Of course Kleiner has had a difficult couple of years. And throughout all of it I wanted to stand up on a hilltop and shout, “I can’t believe that Matt Murphy would ever have to take the stand in a gender bias case. He’s one of the most decent, thoughtful, rational and non-biased venture capitalists I’ve worked with.” I’m sure the two female engineering and ops leaders we’ve had at NextPlus can attest to that. But of course in a legal case it becomes impossible to speak up and I figured my weighing in wouldn’t help in a time where they just had to get through the facts. The court, as you probably know, ultimately exonerated Kleiner and Matt was never mentioned as an individual in the case.\n",
      "I still respect Kleiner Perkins as a firm a great deal. I guess it was time for Matt to get and chart a course at a smaller firm where he could build Phase 2 of his career and I respect that. And at Menlo he found a long-time buddy of his from Stanford Business School and having a close relationship with your partners is certainly a plus in this industry. Menlo having been an early backer in Uber, Warby Parker and others also seems well poised to do well in the future.\n",
      "It’s nice to see when great people land on their feet. And I’m personally pleased to now have a better excuse to find a way to work with Menlo Ventures.\n",

      "Body: Last week AngelList bought Product Hunt. I am always bullish on AngelList and Naval. I really like Ryan Hoover and Product Hunt so I am excited for how it all comes together. I like this piece on the deal. This is the key:\n",
      "“The amount of traffic Product Hunt drives is pretty remarkable,” Yaseen said. “I think it’s a savvy move on AngelList’s part to be able to be the go-to place for the three most important things startups do: fund-raise, hire, and now find and talk to customers.”\n",
      "I have been bullish on AngelList from the first email (curated deal) I got from Naval in 2010.\n",
      "I chatted with my partner Tom and said we need to be investors. He agreed. I do not remember the exact details of the hunt/chase but I was after it. Naval agreed to let us invest and told me that we would hate the terms. That is very Naval. We invested of course.\n",
      "Flash forward and we remain happy and enthusiastic investors/fans/supporters/non solicited advice givers to Naval and AngelList.\n",
      "I always thought LinkedIn could have/should have bought AngelList and attacked the deal making/fundraising sector even bigger time, but now it’s part of Minecraft…I mean Microsoft.\n",
      "There is so much on the table for AngelList to disrupt as money is commoditized and software eats the investing/fundraising universe.\n",

The model does not take anything of the article content into account. The 100% accuracy on the training data means the model is extremly biased. It would be interesting to see if a grid search can find a better set of parameters."

Bag-of-Words is a very simple but often suprisingly effective algorithm. It takes all the different words in a training set and uses them as features. Each article is then transformed into a feature vector by marking the occurrance of each feature (=word). There are a few variations of Bag-of-Words. In it's basic form each vector counts the number of occurences for each word. This is what we are going to use in this Model 3. In the next section (Model 4) will use the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) approach to build the Bag-of-Words vectors.\n",

This saves time when the Notebook is run multiple times. The model needs to be trained only once. 2.) The model can be trained with different classifiers. During experiementation very often different classifiers (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree, SVM) are tested to evaluate which one is most suitable for a problem."

    "Using the logistic regression classifier gets us well above 92% prediction accuracy on the test data set. That's not bad! It appears that simply counting the word frequency is already a very strong differentiator between authors. It seems to confirm our intuition that a person is able to differentiate between authors by what they write about. Different topics will naturally use different vocabulary. For future research (not pursued in this project) it might be interesting to research how the classifier works for authors that write about the same or similar topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the accuracy scores on training and test data we can see that the SVM classifier doesn't perform so well on this particular problem. This comes a bit as a surprise. According to the [scikit learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) SVM is a classifier that generally is effective in high dimensional space and, more importantly, is \"still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples\". In our case the number of 63,021 dimensions (= features) is significantly higher than the 5,756 samples (= number of training articles). Perhaps, because in our case the number of dimensions is almost ten times the number of samples make SVM unsuitable for our problem. The SVM library in scikit learn offers options for optimisation such as various classifiers (SVC, NuSVC and LinearSVC) and different kernel functions. For this project SVM has not been pursued further as the initial results (see above) are way below what the logistic regression classifier achieved."

    "With all the code for Model 3 developed with reusability in mind, we can now quickly implement another model that utlizes the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) approach. In TFIDF, similar to word count, each word represents a feature. Each word is assigned a weight factor that is higher the more often a word occurs in an article. However, at the same time the weight of a word is reduced the more often it occurs across other articles.

    "The performance of the TFIDF model with logistic regression is almost identical to the word count model described in the previous section. The TFIDF of words doesn't help to increase the accuracy in predicting the author. This can be explained by the fact that authors most probably write about specific topics (e.g. entrepreneurship, astrophysics). With this we can expect a high frequency of key topic words within the articles from the same author but less so across all articles in the training set. This in turn means that the IDF part of TFIDF has less impact on the learning. Which then means the TFIDF gets closer to what the word count does."

    "Another approach to numerically represent meaning in text is offered by using word embeddings. Word embedding algorithms such as Word2Vec and GloVe aim to find similar representations for words with similar meanings. Individual words are represented by vectors with tens or a hundred dimensions. These vectors are learned by processing a large amount of text through a neural network. During learning, the algorithm learns the embedding either by predicting the current word based on its context or by predicting the sourounding words given a current word. The result of the embeddings learning phase is a set of vectors where words with similar meanings have similar vectors. Essentially \"similarness\" is reprented by the distance between word vectors. The vector representations of Words with similar meanings have shorter distances between them.\n",

    "In recent years word embedding approaches have been one of the key breakthroughs in natural language processing.\n",

    "A very helpful resource for this topic was the book \"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, Develop Deep Learning Models for Natural Language in Python\" from Jason Brownlee.

This was done as preparation to train the CNN. However, `one_hot` does not encode collision free. During testing it has been found that against a text corpus with 54,619 unique words `one_hot` caused 22,793 collisions. Meaning 22,793 integers were not uniquely mapped to single words. It is believed that this percentage of collisions significantly distorts the learning of the embedding CNN. To resolve this issue function `learn_vocabulary` has been implemented (see below)."
